/// Theme configuration for hover-related widgets and behaviors.

/// interactions throughout the application. It can be registered in the
/// component theme system to customize hover behavior globally.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// HoverTheme(
///   debounceDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 100),
///   hitTestBehavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,
/// )
/// ```
class HoverTheme extends ComponentThemeData {
  /// Debounce duration for repeated hover events.
  ///
  /// When set, hover callbacks are throttled to fire at most once per this duration.
  final Duration? debounceDuration;

  /// Hit test behavior for hover detection.
  ///
  /// Determines how the widget participates in hit testing for mouse events.
  final HitTestBehavior? hitTestBehavior;

  /// Wait duration before showing hover feedback (e.g., tooltips).
  ///
  /// Delays the appearance of hover-triggered UI to avoid flashing on quick passes.
  final Duration? waitDuration;

  /// Minimum duration to keep hover feedback visible once shown.
  ///
  /// Prevents hover UI from disappearing too quickly.
  final Duration? minDuration;

  /// Duration for hover feedback show animations.
  final Duration? showDuration;
