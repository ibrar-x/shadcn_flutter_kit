/// )
/// ```

/// Configuration for window snapping behavior and positioning.
///
/// Defines how windows should snap to screen edges or specific regions,
/// including the target bounds and whether the window should be minimized
/// during the snap operation.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// WindowSnapStrategy(
///   relativeBounds: Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, 0.5, 1), // Left half of screen
///   shouldMinifyWindow: false,
/// )
/// ```

/// Complete state configuration for a window instance.
///
/// Encapsulates all aspects of a window's current state including position, size,
/// visual state (minimized, maximized), capabilities (resizable, draggable), and
/// behavior settings (snapping, always on top).
///
/// Key Properties:
/// - **Position & Size**: [bounds] for current position, [maximized] for fullscreen state
/// - **Visual State**: [minimized] for taskbar state, [alwaysOnTop] for layering
/// - **Capabilities**: [resizable], [draggable], [closable], [maximizable], [minimizable]
/// - **Behavior**: [enableSnapping] for edge snapping, [constraints] for size limits
///
/// Used primarily with [WindowController] to manage window state programmatically
/// and provide reactive updates to window appearance and behavior.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// WindowState(
///   bounds: Rect.fromLTWH(100, 100, 800, 600),
///   resizable: true,
///   draggable: true,
///   enableSnapping: true,
///   constraints: BoxConstraints(minWidth: 400, minHeight: 300),
/// )
/// ```

/// Reactive controller for managing window state and operations.
///
/// Provides programmatic control over window properties with automatic UI updates
/// through [ValueNotifier] pattern. Handles window state management, validation,
/// and coordination with the window widget lifecycle.
///
/// Key Capabilities:
/// - **Reactive Updates**: Automatic UI refresh when state changes
/// - **Property Management**: Convenient getters/setters for window properties
/// - **Lifecycle Handling**: Mount/unmount detection and validation
/// - **State Validation**: Ensures state consistency and constraint compliance
/// - **Handle Management**: Coordination with underlying window implementation
///
/// Usage Pattern:
/// 1. Create controller with initial window configuration
/// 2. Pass to Window.controlled() constructor
/// 3. Modify properties programmatically (bounds, minimized, etc.)
/// 4. UI automatically updates to reflect changes
/// 5. Listen to controller for state change notifications
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final controller = WindowController(
///   bounds: Rect.fromLTWH(100, 100, 800, 600),
///   resizable: true,
///   draggable: true,
/// );
///
/// // Programmatic control
/// controller.bounds = Rect.fromLTWH(200, 200, 900, 700);
/// controller.minimized = true;
/// controller.maximized = Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, 1920, 1080);
///
/// // Listen for changes
/// controller.addListener(() {
///   print('Window state changed: ${controller.value}');
/// });
/// ```

/// A resizable, draggable window widget with title bar and content area.
///
/// Provides a desktop-style window experience with full control over sizing,
/// positioning, and window controls (minimize, maximize, close). Supports both
/// controlled and uncontrolled modes for flexible state management.
///
/// Key Features:
/// - **Resizable**: Drag edges/corners to resize (when enabled)
/// - **Draggable**: Drag title bar to move window (when enabled)
/// - **Maximizable**: Fill screen or custom bounds
/// - **Minimizable**: Collapse to taskbar or hidden state
/// - **Snapping**: Auto-snap to screen edges when dragging near them
/// - **Customizable**: Title, actions, content, and theme settings
///
/// Usage Patterns:
///
/// **Uncontrolled Mode** (direct state props):
/// ```dart
/// WindowWidget(
///   title: Text('My Window'),
///   content: Text('Window content here'),
///   bounds: Rect.fromLTWH(100, 100, 800, 600),
///   resizable: true,
///   draggable: true,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **Controlled Mode** (via controller):
/// ```dart
/// final controller = WindowController(
///   bounds: Rect.fromLTWH(100, 100, 800, 600),
/// );
///
/// WindowWidget.controlled(
///   controller: controller,
///   title: Text('Controlled Window'),
///   content: Text('Content'),
/// )

/// - [WindowController] for programmatic window control

/// Provides a desktop-style window management system where multiple windows
/// can be displayed, dragged, resized, minimized, and maximized.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// WindowNavigator(
///   initialWindows: [
///     Window(
///       controller: WindowController(bounds: Rect.fromLTWH(100, 100, 400, 300)),

/// A comprehensive windowing system for creating desktop-like window interfaces.
///
/// **EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENT** - This component is in active development and APIs may change.
///
/// Provides a complete window management solution with draggable, resizable windows
/// that support minimizing, maximizing, and snapping to screen edges. Designed for
/// desktop-style applications requiring multiple simultaneous content areas.
///
/// Core Features:
/// - **Window Management**: Create, control, and destroy floating windows
/// - **Interactive Behaviors**: Drag, resize, minimize, maximize, close operations
/// - **Snapping System**: Intelligent edge snapping and window positioning
/// - **Layering Control**: Always-on-top and z-order management
/// - **Constraint System**: Size and position limits with validation
/// - **Theme Integration**: Full shadcn_flutter theme and styling support
///
/// Architecture:
/// - **Window**: Immutable window configuration and factory
/// - **WindowController**: Reactive state management for window properties
/// - **WindowWidget**: Stateful widget that renders the actual window
/// - **WindowNavigator**: Container managing multiple windows
///
/// The system supports both controlled (external state management) and
/// uncontrolled (internal state management) modes for different use cases.
///
/// Usage Patterns:
/// 1. **Simple Window**: Basic window with default behaviors
/// 2. **Controlled Window**: External state management with WindowController
/// 3. **Window Navigator**: Multiple windows with shared management
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// // Simple window
/// final window = Window(
///   title: Text('My Window'),
///   content: MyContent(),
///   bounds: Rect.fromLTWH(100, 100, 800, 600),
///   resizable: true,
///   draggable: true,
/// );
///
/// // Controlled window
/// final controller = WindowController(initialState);
/// final controlledWindow = Window.controlled(
///   controller: controller,
///   title: Text('Controlled Window'),
///   content: MyContent(),
/// );

/// - Adding and removing windows from the navigator
/// - Managing window focus and z-order
/// - Controlling always-on-top behavior
/// - Querying window focus state and window list
///

  /// - [window] (Window, required): The window to add

  /// may receive focus, or no window may be focused.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [window] (Window, required): The window to unfocus
  void unfocusWindow(Window window);

  /// Sets whether a window should always appear on top.
  ///
  /// Always-on-top windows remain above other windows even when they

  /// - [window] (Window, required): The window to modify
  /// - [value] (bool, required): True to set always-on-top, false to disable
  void setAlwaysOnTop(Window window, bool value);

/// Data class containing viewport information for a window.

///
/// The viewport information includes:
/// - Size of the visible area
/// - Reference to the navigator managing the window
/// - Focus and display state flags
/// - Interaction state (pointer events, minimization)
///
/// This class is typically used internally by the window system to pass
/// state information to window content and decoration widgets.

/// Default window actions widget providing minimize, maximize, and close buttons.
///
/// This widget provides the standard set of window control buttons typically
/// found in window title bars. The buttons automatically adapt based on the
/// window's capabilities (minimizable, maximizable, closable).
///
/// The widget retrieves window state from the build context using the Data
/// inheritance mechanism, accessing [WindowHandle] and [WindowViewport] data.
///
/// Buttons included:
/// - Minimize button: Collapses the window (if minimizable)
/// - Maximize/Restore button: Toggles between maximized and normal states (if maximizable)
/// - Close button: Closes the window (if closable)
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// Window(
///   title: Text('My Window'),
///   actions: WindowActions(), // Default window controls
///   content: MyContent(),
/// )
