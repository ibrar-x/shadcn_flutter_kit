  /// - [data] (T, required): The data to wrap for sorting operations
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// // Wrapping different data types
  /// SortableData('text_item')
  /// SortableData(42)
  /// SortableData(MyCustomObject(id: 1))

/// A layer widget that manages drag-and-drop sessions for sortable widgets.
///
/// SortableLayer is a required wrapper that coordinates drag-and-drop operations
/// between multiple sortable widgets. It provides the infrastructure for managing
/// drag sessions, rendering ghost elements during dragging, and handling drop
/// animations.
///
/// The layer maintains the drag state and provides a rendering context for ghost
/// widgets that follow the cursor during drag operations. It also manages drop
/// animations and cleanup when drag operations complete.
///
/// Features:
/// - Centralized drag session management across multiple sortable widgets
/// - Ghost widget rendering with cursor following during drag operations
/// - Configurable drop animations with custom duration and curves
/// - Boundary locking to constrain drag operations within the layer bounds
/// - Automatic cleanup and state management for drag sessions
///
/// All sortable widgets must be descendants of a SortableLayer to function properly.
/// The layer should be placed at a level that encompasses all related sortable widgets.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// SortableLayer(
///   lock: true, // Constrain dragging within bounds
///   dropDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 300),
///   dropCurve: Curves.easeOut,
///   child: Column(
///     children: [
///       Sortable(...),
///       Sortable(...),
///       Sortable(...),
///     ],
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
