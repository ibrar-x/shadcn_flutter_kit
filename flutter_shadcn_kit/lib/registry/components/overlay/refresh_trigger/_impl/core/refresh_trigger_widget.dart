  /// - [direction] (Axis, default: Axis.vertical): Pull gesture direction
  /// - [reverse] (bool, default: false): Whether to trigger from opposite direction
  /// - [minExtent] (double?, optional): Minimum pull distance to trigger refresh
  /// - [maxExtent] (double?, optional): Maximum allowed pull distance
  /// - [indicatorBuilder] (RefreshIndicatorBuilder?, optional): Custom indicator widget builder
  /// - [curve] (Curve?, optional): Animation curve for refresh transitions
  /// - [completeDuration] (Duration?, optional): Duration of completion animation
  ///
  /// The [onRefresh] callback should return a Future that completes when the

  /// ```dart

  ///   },
