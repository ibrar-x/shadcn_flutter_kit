  ///
  /// Default values provide a sensible vertical rail configuration suitable

  /// to specific layout requirements and design systems.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [children] (`List<NavigationBarItem>`, required): Navigation destinations
  /// - [alignment] (NavigationRailAlignment, default: center): Item alignment along main axis
  /// - [direction] (Axis, default: vertical): Layout orientation of the rail
  /// - [labelType] (NavigationLabelType, default: selected): When to show labels
  /// - [labelPosition] (NavigationLabelPosition, default: bottom): Label positioning
  /// - [index] (int?, optional): Currently selected item index
  /// - [onSelected] (`ValueChanged<int>?`, optional): Selection change callback
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// NavigationRail(
  ///   alignment: NavigationRailAlignment.start,
  ///   labelType: NavigationLabelType.all,
  ///   index: currentIndex,
  ///   onSelected: (index) => _navigate(index),
