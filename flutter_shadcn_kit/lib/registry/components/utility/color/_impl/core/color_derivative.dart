/// An abstract base class representing a color that can be transformed between different color spaces.
///
/// [ColorDerivative] provides a unified interface for working with colors in various color spaces
/// (HSV, HSL, RGB) while maintaining transformation capabilities. This is particularly useful
/// in color picker implementations where users may want to work with different color models.
///
/// The class supports:
/// - Conversion between HSV, HSL, and RGB color spaces
/// - Individual channel manipulation (hue, saturation, value/lightness, red, green, blue, opacity)
/// - Preserving the internal color representation when transforming
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// // Create from a Flutter Color
/// final derivative = ColorDerivative.fromColor(Colors.blue);
///
/// // Modify saturation
/// final desaturated = derivative.changeToHSVSaturation(0.5);
///
/// // Convert back to Color
/// final newColor = desaturated.toColor();
/// ```
