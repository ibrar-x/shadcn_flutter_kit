/// A widget adapter that bridges controlled component logic with custom UI implementations.
///
/// This adapter provides a standardized way to implement controlled components
/// by handling the common logic for value management, controller integration,
/// and state synchronization. It implements the [ControlledComponent] mixin
/// and manages the lifecycle of value updates between controllers and UI.
///
/// The adapter supports both controlled mode (with a [controller]) and
/// uncontrolled mode (with an [initialValue]). When a controller is provided,
/// it becomes the source of truth for the component's value. When no controller
/// is provided, the component maintains its own internal state.
///
/// The generic type [T] represents the type of value this adapter manages.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// ControlledComponentAdapter<String>(
///   initialValue: 'Hello',
///   onChanged: (value) => print('Value changed: $value'),
///   builder: (context, data) {
///     return GestureDetector(
///       onTap: () => data.onChanged('${data.value}!'),
///       child: Text(data.value),
///     );
///   },
/// );
/// ```
