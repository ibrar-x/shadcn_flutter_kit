# Getting Started

Hello! This folder is your new component. Think of it like a small toy box with labeled bins so you always know where things go.

## Folder Map
- `README.md` tells people what the component is.
- `meta.json` is the label the registry uses to install the component.
- `gooey_toast.dart` is the main widget that people import.
- `preview.dart` is for the gallery preview.
- `_impl/` is the private toolbox for helper code.

## Inside `_impl/`
- `_impl/core/` for the main building blocks.
- `_impl/state/` for controllers and state logic.
- `_impl/styles/` for styles and style helpers.
- `_impl/themes/` for theme data and theme helpers.
- `_impl/utils/` for small helper functions.
- `_impl/variants/` for variant widgets and styles.
- `_impl/extensions/` for extension methods.

If you do not need a folder yet, it can stay empty. That is okay.
