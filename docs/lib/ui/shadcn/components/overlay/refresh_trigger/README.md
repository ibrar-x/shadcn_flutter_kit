# Refresh Trigger (`refresh_trigger`)

Pull-to-refresh wrapper with customizable indicator, extents, and completion animations.

---

## When to use

- Use this when:
  - you need a pull-to-refresh interaction on scrollables.
  - you want custom indicator visuals.
- Avoid when:
  - you already use platform-specific refresh controls.

## Install

```bash
flutter_shadcn add refresh_trigger
```

---

## Import

```dart
import 'package:<your_app>/ui/shadcn/overlay/refresh_trigger/refresh_trigger.dart';

  onRefresh: () async {
    await fetchLatest();
  },

```

## Common patterns

### Pattern: Custom indicator

RefreshTrigger(
  indicatorBuilder: (context, stage) => DefaultRefreshIndicator(stage: stage),
  onRefresh: () async {},
  child: ListView(children: const [Text('Item')]),
)
```
