/// A swipeable container that transitions between multiple child widgets.
///
/// [Switcher] provides smooth animated transitions between different views
/// with gesture-based navigation. Users can swipe to change the active view,
/// and the component supports all four axis directions for transitions.
///
/// Features include:
/// - Gesture-based drag navigation between views
/// - Smooth animated transitions with configurable duration and curve
/// - Support for all axis directions (up, down, left, right)
/// - Automatic snapping to the nearest index after dragging
/// - Programmatic control via index changes
///
/// The component uses a custom render object to handle smooth interpolation
/// between child sizes and positions during transitions.
///
/// **Note: This component is experimental and may change in future versions.**
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// Switcher(
///   index: currentIndex,
///   direction: AxisDirection.right,
///   onIndexChanged: (newIndex) => setState(() => currentIndex = newIndex),
///   children: [
///     Container(color: Colors.red, child: Center(child: Text('Page 1'))),
///     Container(color: Colors.blue, child: Center(child: Text('Page 2'))),
///     Container(color: Colors.green, child: Center(child: Text('Page 3'))),
///   ],
/// );
/// ```
