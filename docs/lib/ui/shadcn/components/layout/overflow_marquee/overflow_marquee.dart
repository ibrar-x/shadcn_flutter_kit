/// Theme configuration for [OverflowMarquee] scrolling text displays.
///
/// Provides comprehensive styling and behavior options for marquee animations
/// including scroll direction, timing, fade effects, and animation curves.
/// All properties are optional and will fall back to default values when not specified.
///
/// Animation Properties:
/// - [direction]: Horizontal or vertical scrolling axis
/// - [duration]: Complete cycle time for one full scroll
/// - [delayDuration]: Pause time before restarting animation
/// - [curve]: Easing function for smooth animation transitions
///
/// Visual Properties:
/// - [step]: Pixel step size for scroll speed calculation
/// - [fadePortion]: Edge fade effect intensity (0.0 to 1.0)
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// OverflowMarqueeTheme(
///   direction: Axis.horizontal,
///   duration: Duration(seconds: 5),
///   delayDuration: Duration(seconds: 1),
///   fadePortion: 0.1,
///   curve: Curves.easeInOut,
/// )
/// ```

/// Automatically scrolling widget for content that overflows its container.
///
/// Creates smooth, continuous scrolling animation for content that exceeds the
/// available space. Commonly used for long text labels, news tickers, or any
/// content that needs horizontal or vertical scrolling to be fully visible.
///
/// Key Features:
/// - **Auto-scroll Detection**: Only animates when content actually overflows
/// - **Bi-directional Support**: Horizontal and vertical scrolling modes
/// - **Edge Fading**: Smooth fade effects at container boundaries
/// - **Customizable Timing**: Configurable duration, delay, and animation curves
/// - **Performance Optimized**: Uses Flutter's Ticker system for smooth 60fps animation
/// - **Theme Integration**: Respects OverflowMarqueeTheme configuration
///
/// Animation Behavior:
/// 1. Measures content size vs. container size
/// 2. If content fits, displays normally without animation
/// 3. If content overflows, starts continuous scrolling animation
/// 4. Scrolls content from start to end position
/// 5. Pauses briefly (delayDuration) before restarting
/// 6. Applies edge fade effects for smooth visual transitions
///
/// The widget automatically handles text direction (RTL/LTR) and adapts
/// scroll behavior accordingly for proper internationalization support.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// OverflowMarquee(
///   direction: Axis.horizontal,
///   duration: Duration(seconds: 8),
///   delayDuration: Duration(seconds: 2),
///   fadePortion: 0.15,
///   child: Text(
///     'This is a very long text that will scroll horizontally when it overflows the container',
///     style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
