  /// Content can be provided through individual title/header/subtitle parameters
  /// or by using the [child] parameter for complete custom layouts. Leading

  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [leading] (`List<Widget>`, default: []): Leading area widgets (left side)
  /// - [trailing] (`List<Widget>`, default: []): Trailing area widgets (right side)
  /// - [title] (Widget?, optional): Primary title content
  /// - [header] (Widget?, optional): Secondary content above title
  /// - [subtitle] (Widget?, optional): Secondary content below title
  /// - [child] (Widget?, optional): Custom content (overrides title components)
  /// - [alignment] (AlignmentGeometry, default: center): Content alignment
  /// - [trailingExpanded] (bool, default: false): Whether trailing area expands
  /// - [useSafeArea] (bool, default: depends on context): Handle system intrusions
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// AppBar(
  ///   leading: [BackButton()],
  ///   title: Text('Settings'),
  ///   trailing: [
  ///     IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.help), onPressed: _showHelp),
  ///     PopupMenuButton(items: menuItems),
  ///   ],
