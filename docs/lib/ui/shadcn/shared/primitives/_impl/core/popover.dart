/// A controller for managing multiple popovers and their lifecycle.
///
/// [PopoverController] provides centralized management for popover instances,
/// including creation, lifecycle tracking, and coordination between multiple
/// popovers. It handles the complexity of overlay management and provides
/// a clean API for popover operations.
///
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - Creating and showing new popovers
/// - Tracking active popover instances
/// - Coordinating close operations across popovers
/// - Managing popover lifecycle states
/// - Providing status queries for open/mounted popovers
///
/// The controller maintains a list of active popovers and provides methods
/// to query their status, close them individually or collectively, and
/// coordinate their display behavior.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
///   @override
///   _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
/// }
///
/// class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
///   final PopoverController _popoverController = PopoverController();
///
///   @override
///   void dispose() {
///     _popoverController.dispose();
///     super.dispose();
///   }
///
///   void _showMenu() async {
///     await _popoverController.show(
///       context: context,
///       alignment: Alignment.bottomStart,
///       builder: (context) => MyPopoverContent(),
///     );
///   }
/// }
/// ```
